                            I'm a recent grad Software Developer with a passion for seamless, end-to-end,
                            user experiences. I'm capable of working across the tech-stack, having developed
                            three-tier applications in both web and mobile environments.

                            I use AI to learn quickly and efficiently, utilizing dialog with LLMs to fill gaps
                            in my understanding of concepts. I believe in continuous learning, and I'm
                            currently looking for a working environment where I can contribute meaningfully
                            and leverage my skills to add value.
